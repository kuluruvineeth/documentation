## Getting Started

To view your analytics, click on the `Comments` tab in the left sidebar. Or visit [this link](https://www.openstudio.co.in/studio).

The comment client is still a work in progress. It lacks a lot of basic functionality you'd expect from an comment client.
It's not intended to replace your current comment client today. But we're constantly working on improving it.

### Run AI on old comments

You can use the comment client to categorize your comments using AI, and also run the AI automation on older ecomments.

To run the AI automation on old comments, hover over an comment, and click the `Run AI action` button that appears.

You can also bulk run the AI automation on multiple ecomments by selecting multiple ecomments and clicking the `Run AI action` button at the top of the screen.

### Send an comment with AI

To compose a new comment with AI, press `command+k` on your keyboard, and then click `Compose`.
Then type `/` or `++` to use the AI autocompletion.
You can also use AI autocompletion when replying to ecomments.
To do this click the reply icon, and an comment composer will appear with AI autocompletion.

### Roadmap

These are the features we are working on adding to the comment client to make it feature complete:

- Viewing comments by label
- Forwarding comments
- Replying to specific comments
- Add CC/BCC when sending comments
- View CC when receiving comments
