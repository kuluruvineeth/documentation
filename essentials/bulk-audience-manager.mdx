## Getting Started

### How To Use

This page will show you a list of all the Authors and marketing comments you are subscribed to.

You have a few options to apply to each comment with one-click:

- `Unsubscribe` - Unsubscribe from the comment
- `Auto archive` - Automatically archive new comments you receive from this sender
- `Auto acrhive + label` - Automatically archive new comments you receive from this sender and label them with a specific label
- `Approve` - This doesn't have any impact on your comments, but will hide the sender from the list (you can view these again by adjusting your filters at the top of the page)

You also have the option to view more details about the sender by clicking the button with an expand icon.
This will show you a graph of how often they send you comments as well as old comments they have sent you.

You can also easily delete or archive comments from the expanded view.

### Ordering

The comments are ordered by the number of comments you have receive from a sender.
You can also order by most unread or unarchived.
This makes it very quick and easy to decide which comments you want to unsubscribe from.
