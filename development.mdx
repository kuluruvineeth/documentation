This page is for developers who want to set up Open Studio locally. Full details are available in the GitHub [README](https://www.openstudio.co.in/github). We also have a video available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVQENQ4WT2Y):

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

To run Open Studio locally, you'll need to set up your environment variables and install the dependencies:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm i
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

</CodeGroup>

The app is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

We use Vercel to deploy Open Studio. Make sure to set all the environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tinybird isn't working">
    Make sure you have the correct region set. You can adjust the region in the `.env` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm getting rate limited by Gmail">
    This can happen if your Gmail account is connected to another service that's making requests.

    To fix this you can check what other services are connected to your Gmail account and remove any that you don't need.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm getting rate limited by OpenAI">
    To solve this you can:

    * Use a different AI model with higher rate limits.
    * Move to a higher tier on OpenAPI that has increased rate limits.
    * Slow down the rate at which you are making requests.
